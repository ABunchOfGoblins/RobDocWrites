                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Baker wondered what the protesters would think of him as the SUV&#39;s headlights swung across the group. Their signs and faces were lit up in the hard white of the
                LEDs, framed in his mind forever as if in a camera&#39;s flash.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stood in front of the gate and moved slowly, prompting the driver to lay on the horn which did nothing to speed them up. &quot;Sorry Father,&quot; he said over his
                shoulder. &quot;There&#39;s always a few, but this one&#39;s got some national coverage behind it. More people always turn out then.&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Father Baker replied automatically, as his gaze stayed on the protesters. &quot;What time is it?&quot; he asked, twisting in his seat, eyes still on
                the protesters.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Little before ten,&quot; the driver said, glancing at the dashboard. &quot;Governor signed the bill about four hours ago and it goes into effect at midnight, so they
                pretty much immediately got the ball rolling and started calling around for one of you&mdash;at the guy&#39;s request, obviously.&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Baker swallowed hard, not entirely sure he wanted to hear the procedural details, and not needing to hear those he already knew, repeated. A tiny part of him
                couldn&#39;t help but feel&mdash;or feel as if others felt&mdash;that he was facilitating or legitimizing the practice just by being present. For all the column articles and impassioned opinions, the religious figure
                everyone knew was guaranteed never seemed to come up anywhere in the debate.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll have to frisk you once we&#39;re inside&mdash;policy for anyone going back to the cell blocks&mdash;but it&#39;s just a formality, not like a cavity search or
                anything.&quot; The driver laughed.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Alright.&quot; Father Baker had been tired, winding down his day when he&#39;d gotten the call. Seeing a federal prison on caller ID had been a new experience, and ever
                since then he&#39;d been awake like he&#39;d downed a quart of espresso.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cell was larger than Father Baker had imagined, but he realized he hadn&#39;t thought much about it until he was standing in it. A shelf along one wall was crammed with
                books, the titles ranging from serial mysteries to books on theoretical physics. Another was filled with journals&mdash;and the journals themselves filled with writing, judging by their weathered, bulging nature.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know they get a T.V. in some states?&quot; The Inmate said.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, I don&#39;t think I did,&quot; Father Baker replied.</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think they&#39;re afraid I&#39;ll smash it and slash my wrists with the pieces,&quot; he said, laughing. &quot;Then again they let me have a pencil, so who knows.&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Baker laughed with The Inmate, but it felt forced to him. He was trying to shed his discomfort&mdash;by force&mdash;with limited success.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the guards returned with a metal chair and set it down just inside the cell. &quot;No time limit,&quot; he said, &quot;but we&#39;ll come get you when it&#39;s time to
                go.&quot; He turned to the priest. &quot;You can leave any time&mdash;or he can ask that you do&mdash;but otherwise you&#39;re free to go with him until the end. They&#39;ll talk you both through some last minute things once
                they come for him though. Good?&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest nodded. &nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thanks, Walt,&quot; The Inmate said.</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&#39;Course,&quot; the guard said with a curt nod before turning away. Father Baker noticed a strange intertwining of coldness and familiarity in the guard&#39;s words as
                he sat down and heard the key in the lock with a heavy thunk.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the guard was down the hall, The Inmate said, &quot;He&#39;s a good guy. Daughter survived leukemia a couple years ago. He&#39;d show me pictures of her sometimes through
                treatment, real cute kid.&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Really?&quot; Father Baker tried to square that with the distance he&#39;d just seen between the two of them.</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah. Don&#39;t worry, he&#39;s a nice guy, really. The last time I almost got the needle, they were all the same way. Sometimes I think they&#39;re more uncomfortable
                about the whole thing than I am, but I guess that&#39;s natural. He goes home to a daughter and a wife, one of the other guys, Eddie, he takes care of his mother, and Joan&#39;s boyfriend just proposed to her like a month
                ago.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;They&#39;ve got places to go. Don&#39;t gotta think about the end as much.&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence welled between them and The Inmate coughed. The priest wanted to say something but nothing came to mind that felt appropriate&mdash;especially not &quot;I&#39;m
                sorry,&quot; or any other apologetic platitudes, despite the natural reflex to reach for those.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you practice?&quot; Father Baker finally asked, trying not to sound like an interviewer.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Religion, you mean?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Father nodded.</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not so much. Grew up going to Church with my mother, but once she died I never felt like going back. Didn&#39;t avoid it or anything, it just never really occurred to me
                to go, since I&#39;d been going for her I realized.&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Your father never went?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inmate snorted. &quot;If he did, I think they&#39;d have seen through him before the priest made it to the pulpit.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He wasn&#39;t a bad person I don&#39;t think, but not a holy one. Definitely a sinner.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Churches accommodate those just as well as the pious.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inmate shrugged. &quot;I think my dad was in that middle area.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of what?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bad enough to need some redemption, but not good enough to go get it, you know?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Baker nodded. &quot;Ah, I see what you mean. What about you?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inmate&#39;s eyes flicked up to meet Father Baker&#39;s briefly. &quot;Suppose that depends on who you ask.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m asking you,&quot; the priest said, smiling lightly.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Asking the wrong person then.&quot; The Inmate&#39;s eyes cast downward and his hands twisted on themselves, elbows on his knees.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest searched for what to say next. The fact he&#39;d never done this before was catching up with him.</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ve been here for 17 years, I&#39;ve had a lot of time to think and I probably &nbsp;feel better about things than most people think.&quot; He paused, drawing in a
                breath and looking across the cell as if there was a landscape to take in. &quot;After a couple years, you just kind of stop thinking about &#39;out there.&#39; It&#39;s like&hellip;Europe, or Japan or something. I know
                about &lsquo;em, but &nbsp;after a lot of time it feels like a whole other place. Even though it&#39;s just on the other side of the wall it feels distant since you only get to hear about it in books and newspapers. Not even
                T.V.,&quot; he said, glancing back at Father Baker with a smile and they both chuckled.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence again. Father Baker could hold a conversation any place or time about God, the Bible, or spirituality. A priest was often asked to play the role of therapist and
                Father Baker could imagine how his superiors and those with many years of priesthood behind them would seamlessly blend the two but everything he could say seemed hollow and unimportant. They may not have the language of a
                clinician, but men of the cloth got to much the same place. Father Baker though, still learning the names of his first flock of parishioners, felt tongue-tied and useless.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When did they call you?&quot; The Inmate asked. </span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, two hours ago or so.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What did you think?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Baker rolled a reply around on his tongue, unsure of what to say. &quot;I felt a lot of things.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Like what?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, seeing a federal prison on caller ID was a new one,&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ha, I bet! How&#39;d they tell you why they called?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They didn&#39;t really need to. Federal prison calls a priest&mdash;especially late at night&mdash;it&#39;s not much of a puzzle. Plus I get the newspaper. They&#39;ve
                been talking about&hellip;this.&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fair, fair. How many of these have you done?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest chuckled and his face reddened slightly. &quot;Well I hope you don&#39;t mind, but this is my first.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well no shit! The last time they almost got the bill passed, it never got signed so I never got a priest or anything. So this is a first for me too! S&#39;pose it&#39;s a
                first for most guys though. Guess that means we can figure out how to do this together, huh?&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pair started laughing, and a vague part of Father Baker acknowledged how absurd it might seem on the outside to be sharing a joke with this man. But within the bars of the
                cell, it was beginning to feel entirely natural.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now I really gotta know what was going through your mind.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Baker shook his head slowly and took in a long breath. &quot;Honestly I don&#39;t even think I can say. It was kind of blank, it was surreal. Guess you could call it
                autopilot, actually.&quot; He started to chuckle. &quot;I think I started to feel normal again as we started talking.&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inmate laughed too. &quot;The guy on death row brings you back to the world of the living.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Baker laughed harder and never forgot that sentence. He started to wonder what was written in The Inmate&#39;s notebooks&mdash;and what would happen to them the next
                morning.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment their laughter died and Father Baker asked, &quot;Not everyone in your&mdash;on death row, requests a religious figure.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was, and wasn&#39;t, a question.</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; The Inmate answered. &quot;S&#39;pose I didn&#39;t really want a religious figure, if I&#39;m honest&mdash;or didn&#39;t need one, I guess I mean. They
                don&#39;t offer &#39;friend figures&#39; though, and I think the only people I could talk to like that anymore wear a badge anyway.&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, I can be that too. But a friend can&#39;t take confession if that&#39;s what you want,&quot; Father Baker joked. As soon as it passed his lips, he wondered if that
                was the right thing to have said and if The Inmate would actually find it funny. Before he could begin to apologize though, The Inmate started to chuckle.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No offense Father, but twelve people from this great state seem to agree I&#39;m past that.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relief at having not offended The Inmate washed over Father Baker, but at the same time he knit his brow in some confusion over what The Inmate had said.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They didn&#39;t do anything like that, they just agreed with a prosecutor.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inmate paused for a moment. &quot;You think I&#39;m innocent?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t think it matters, killing you doesn&#39;t seem to make a lot of sense.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The priest isn&#39;t so hot on Old Testament punishment?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just because I vote for a guy for President doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m co-signing on his every statement, right? We&#39;ve revised the book enough times that the
                &#39;letter of the law&#39; isn&#39;t the same anymore. You could be here for having a boyfriend if the Church still abided by the Old Testament. If the crimes can change, so can the punishments I think.&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Some people would prefer it the old way.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And I&#39;d rather not have those people in my audience on Sunday morning.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inmate crossed his arms, narrowed his eyes, and leaned back in his chair. &quot;I figured most of you for the fire and brimstone types. &#39;Bring it on, he violated
                God&#39;s will!&#39; That sort of thing.&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c2">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Baker nodded. &quot;I&#39;ve known a few of those. They never seemed especially happy to me, and their parishioners&hellip;they didn&#39;t seem much better.&quot; He
                smiled a thin smile that said,
            </span>
            <span class="c2 c6">Let&#39;s just leave it at that for now</span><span class="c0">.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Regardless,&quot; The Inmate started, unfurling his arms, &quot;a vote to convict can&#39;t help but feel like &#39;a vote of unconfidence in one&#39;s
                character&#39;.&quot; He affected a noble tone as he spoke, mocking the court&#39;s pretentiousness.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s what I meant when I said they just agreed with a prosecutor. That doesn&#39;t mean anything about your character, they didn&#39;t get to know you, they got to
                know an argument presented by an attorney.&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inmate was silent.</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You don&#39;t have to use me for confession or last rites or anything if you don&#39;t want to&mdash;you can send me away or we can talk about baseball if that sounds
                better to you&mdash;but I don&#39;t think you sitting here, no matter how you got here, is so severe of a judgment of your character that God is going to turn his face away from you.&quot; Without really intending to, Father
                Baker had leaned forward in his chair and grown serious as he spoke.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inmate let quiet hang between them before allowing a small smile onto his lips. &quot;So you think I&#39;m guilty, I just don&#39;t deserve the needle&mdash;or a bullet,
                now?&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Baker laughed at The Inmate&#39;s insistence and said, hands splayed as if proving his honesty, &quot;If you have to know, I barely know the details of your case.
                &nbsp;I didn&#39;t live here when it happened and they never even bothered to &lsquo;brief me&rsquo; or anything on the way here.&quot; He&#39;d been nervous to admit as much at the beginning, but now he didn&#39;t feel like
                he had a choice.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately The Inmate burst out laughing. &quot;They sent me a first time priest, new to the area, and no idea who I am.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t forget, they sent the first one that picked up the phone,&quot; Father Baker said, smiling more broadly. The Inmate laughed harder and slapped his thigh as he
                doubled over.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Swear to God,&quot; he said between breaths, &ldquo;can&#39;t make this shit up.&quot; The Inmate didn&#39;t notice, but Father Baker smiled inwardly that stuffier
                priests would&rsquo;ve taken umbrage at his use of the Lord&#39;s name.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laughter between them subsided and they both sat in quiet, getting their breath back.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Somehow I thought this was going to be more somber than it is,&quot; Father Baker said.</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inmate shrugged. &quot;You had to go past the other cells on the row, I&#39;m not alone. Some of &#39;em, newer guys on the row mostly, they don&#39;t handle being here as
                well.&quot; His voice got quieter. &quot;I know I didn&#39;t, when I got here.&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Baker felt more comfortable now, enough to risk asking a question he wouldn&#39;t have earlier. &quot;Does it feel&hellip;closer? When you first get here?&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; The Inmate nodded. He kept nodding for a moment and continued, &quot;I think in your head you know this shit takes years, there&#39;s always appeals, dates
                get scheduled and then moved around, nowadays they gotta get the drugs in the first place&mdash;or used to anyway&mdash;that kind of stuff. So you know it&#39;s not gonna be tomorrow or even next year probably, but it
                feels&hellip;you already feel like they killed you, I guess. You&#39;ve spent years behind bars before you get to trial and everything, but somehow that day, going back to the cell after it&#39;s all over. It&#39;s like
                going back in a cell for the first time, only a thousand times worse because now they took away the one last thing you had.&quot; He paused, fighting a closing throat and encroaching despair that rose to his face and clouded
                over the genial quality he&#39;d worn since Father Baker arrived. &quot;Hope is for the living, and it feels like they killed you the moment they read out that verdict.&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something uncoiled in Father Baker as The Inmate spoke. The contrast of the lightheartedness a moment before revealed a frustration, some lashing, tear-stained thing squirming
                and fighting under the weight of an astonishing needlessness. The fact that &quot;why&quot; didn&#39;t seem to have any answer&mdash;let alone a reasonable one&mdash;felt disqualifying all on its own as he sat across from
                one of the few men on Earth whose life could be set to an alarm clock. It wasn&#39;t as if Father Baker hadn&#39;t thought some about it beforehand, either in the black SUV that had picked him up or in the years prior as the
                debate over capital punishment routinely made its way into the newspapers, but it wasn&#39;t the same sterile, philosophical debate that it had always been presented as.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a car struggling to start, a smile flickered across The Inmate&#39;s face before catching and settling there with a sigh and a shrug. </span>
            <span class="c2 c6">What can you do? </span>
            <span class="c0">
                his expression seemed to say. Appeals had all been roundly defeated, the reality was that the next morning&#39;s paper would bear his name across the front page, and at that moment he would become a statistic, a number added
                to a graph for social workers and activists to present with fervor in making their case to a generally apathetic public.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Baker had never figured himself for a very political person and he knew that many around the country would point to the more torrid elements of the bible as evidence of
                his hypocrisy&mdash;a fact he wouldn&#39;t attempt to deny&mdash;but sitting across from The Inmate, none of it felt political. It didn&#39;t even really feel barbaric, as so many would claim. In the small silence that let
                Father Baker&#39;s thoughts whirl, it struck him as&hellip;illogical. Again, that question of &quot;why&quot; floated across his mind, but instead of becoming imbued with frustration and rage, this time there was a sort of
                pleading confusion. A lack of understanding, as if someone was insisting to him that two and two was five, but with a man&#39;s life dependent on the accuracy of the sum.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inmate took a deep breath, sucking out the silence from between them. &quot;Why did you become a priest?&quot; he asked.</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Baker was taken somewhat aback by the question. The transition in The Inmate&#39;s tone and expression was gradual, but fast&mdash;faster than his own, without a doubt.
                &quot;Um,&quot; Father Baker swallowed, &quot;My, well, I had some troubles in college, in my freshman year. Before that, too, I guess, but it was&hellip;college made it harder.&quot; He made the decision to cut himself off
                before realizing he&#39;d only intimated an answer to The Inmate&#39;s question.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So you went to, like, priest school instead?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Images came to him of white hospital sheets spattered with blood, gauze wrapped around both wrists, shouting voices and rushing footsteps. </span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Something like that,&quot; Father Baker said, pushing the images aside and putting on a smile like a cheap suit. &quot;It focused me. Gave me something to look for.&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inmate nodded, eyes distant. Father Baker wondered what was going through The Inmate&#39;s mind, whether he should say more. Whether he should tell him that his roommate
                came home from class early, still hungover, only to find him collapsed on the bathroom tile, slick with bright red arterial blood. Or so he&#39;d been told later, at the hospital.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Would you pray with me?&quot; The Inmate asked, eyes still downcast.</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course. Do you have a passage you like?&quot; Father Baker asked, producing a small traveling bible and leafing through its thin pages as he welcomed the distraction
                from his own thoughts.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inmate said no and the pair of them bowed their heads. In the car ride, Father Baker had frantically thought of some passages that seemed appropriate but suddenly none of
                them felt that way anymore. So he shut the bible and rested it on his knee to say something of his own.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Baker spoke for a minute or two and was about to wind down his prayer when he heard the squeak of leather boots on polished linoleum. He swallowed hard and felt his
                pulse spike as he and The Inmate opened their eyes and straightened at the same time.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey Walt,&quot; The Inmate said, the brightness in his voice not sounding forced at all.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard took a deep breath and said, evenly, &quot;Time to go.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room had been retrofitted quickly and obviously. The gurney with its straps and thick padding was gone, the hole in the floor that held it covered with an X of blue
                painter&#39;s tape. On the far side of the room, away from the spectating windows, a metal chair was placed with small mountains of sandbags around the legs and straps attached to the arms. A crenelated wall of sandbags was
                nearer the windows with gaps for the shooters to place their rifles, aimed toward the modern crucifix at the other end.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From behind the glass, Father Baker watched. He hadn&#39;t given thought to it, but defaulted to sitting on the side of the family&mdash;only a sister&mdash;along with a
                handful of reporters. A man in National Guard fatigues&mdash;presumably the provider of the sandbags&mdash;packed down the last of them and made sure the wall was solid before leaving the room. Father Baker felt a bit like
                being at a concert with the man in fatigues making final adjustments on instruments and sound equipment before the band came out for the main event. The comparison sat in his stomach like bad tequila.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way they happened to file into the room, Father Baker ended up next to The Inmate&#39;s sister in the front row. On the one hand, the idea of being so close to the
                glass made his pulse quicken uncomfortably, but he did his best to calm down by reminding himself that ten feet back in the third or fourth row wouldn&#39;t really be any different.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cleared his throat. &quot;Are you his sister?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She jumped slightly. &quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Baker nodded dumbly, realizing he&#39;d started a conversation with no means to continue it.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you a reporter?&quot; she asked, looking for either a recording device or pad of paper and pencil.</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, no. I&#39;m a priest, but we generally leave out vestments at the Church&mdash;they&#39;re not exactly right for grocery getting.&quot;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corners of her mouth twitched slightly in the smallest smile. &quot;How was he?&quot; she asked in a hollow voice.</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an impossible question. Father Baker wanted to tell her that he&#39;d been laughing, that he seemed to be okay and that the years waiting for this moment had inoculated
                him to the worst of the emotions around it. But at the same time he felt he would be torturing her by saying as much, as if he was robbing her of her last chance to see him that way simply by recounting it.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We prayed together. I think it helped him.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eyes flashed. &quot;He prayed?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Baker said yes. </span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I didn&#39;t know he&#39;d started believing again.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think he just wanted to believe in something.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded and hung her head. For a moment Father Baker thought she was lost in thought, but then noticed that her eyes were jammed shut and her shoulders rocked with tears she
                was straining to keep in. A loose grouping of reporters started to take notes which made Father Baker more self conscious about how he should respond.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to-&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She interrupted him with a wave. &quot;No,&quot; she said, digging in her purse for a wad of tissues. &quot;It&#39;s, um, damn near anything can&hellip;can do this, right
                now.&quot;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;D-do you want a hug? Or something? I can get some fresh tissues I think.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s fine.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Baker had been expecting a certain amount of consoling with The Inmate but strangely hadn&#39;t needed to do as much as he expected. Now that he was being asked to
                console, it caught him off guard and he felt foolish, as if he were making things worse.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c6">You&#39;ve got to be kidding me</span>
            <span class="c2">, Father Baker thought as he saw the door in the execution chamber open while The Inmate&rsquo;s sister barely got her tears under control. </span>
            <span class="c2">A pair of guards walked through with The Inmate in the middle, hands and feet shackled, constraining him to the shuffling gait of the old man he would never be. </span>
            <span class="c0">
                His sister heard it and looked up, her shoulders sagging at the sight as if she&#39;d gone light-headed. She took long, slow breaths and managed to force a sense of calm back onto her exterior, but just sitting beside her
                Father Baker could feel that it was a facade&mdash;a matter of appearances.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guards sat The Inmate in the chair. Attaching his shackles to its frame, they then slipped a black hood over his head and pinned a white target to his left breast.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the black cloth covered The Inmate&#39;s face, Father Baker felt a primal fear stab at him from a deep part of his brain. Something deep in the evolutionary history of man
                that had been taught that all things are a matter of avoiding or delaying death began to shriek at him. A visceral wrongness, a horror as existential as it was physical. Without intending to, he extended his hand, palm up,
                to The Inmate&#39;s sister. She took it, squeezing with a ferocity that would have caused Father Baker to cry out at any other time.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door in the execution chamber opened again. Four men and a woman walked through, all dressed in plain black with serious faces. Each one carried a lever-action rifle which
                struck Father Baker as darkly comedic, like a cruel joke alluding to frontier justice. A moment later the warden and a man with a leather satchel entered.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fivesome lined up behind the sandbags, rifles rested on them, barrels pointed up.</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warden and the seventh man took their place behind the shooters. After a brief pause the warden began, in a loud voice as if delivering a speech, to inform The Inmate that,
                by the power of the state and by the will of the people, he was sentenced to death and the manner in which the deed would be done was, in accordance with state and federal law, a firing squad.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warden paused a moment before addressing The Inmate again.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you have any last words?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything paused. Reality itself seemed to halt and look up from its duty, as if to say, </span><span class="c2 c6">It&#39;s really happening</span>
            <span class="c0">
                , with wide-eyed disbelief. Dust motes hung in the air, lungs and hearts paused as if in deference to the event. The world collapsed to a single point in which a man&#39;s final agency was given him by his killers.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Even if I could find the words, I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ve got the time.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warden looked taken aback, but covered it well. The riflemen stayed impassive like they hadn&#39;t heard anything.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Father Baker heard a twinge of fear in The Inmate&rsquo;s words he hadn&#39;t before.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rifles,&quot; the warden called, back to his commandant&#39;s authoritativeness.</span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The riflemen leveled their barrels at the target on The Inmate&#39;s chest and leaned into the butt of their rifles as the warden began a countdown.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;141 seconds after entering the chamber, </span><span class="c2">The Inmate</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was dead.</span></p>
        <p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rest of his life, any time he put on a mask or had his vision obscured unexpectedly, Father Baker would hear the synchronized crack of five rifles and see the
                slack-jawed face of The Inmate as the man with the satchel pulsed a light across his eyes and felt his jugular a moment later.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            <span class="c0">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father Baker would go on to perform last rites and advocate for death row prisoners at every opportunity. But he would never again be present for an execution.
